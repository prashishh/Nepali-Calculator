A Nepali Calculator build using AngularJS and Pure. This calculator is derived from the work done by rabidgadfly (why rebuild the wheel again, huh?).

Note: This is not ready for use. Work still being done. Keep in touch.

Features:
- Basic Calculator with nepali fonts
- Converts Nepali Digits to Language. It uses the nepDigit library that I had made long time back.
